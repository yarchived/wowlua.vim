WTF is this?
============

[wowlua.dict] dict that contains wow lua APIs, event names and widget apis
[wowlua.vim] vim syntax file that highlights apis in wow lua

[chunk.xml] notepad++ syntax

How to use?
===========

[wowlua.dict] modify your vimrc::
    set dictionary+=/path/to/wowlua.dict

[wowlua.vim] syntax file, put it in $VIMRUNTIME/syntax, or don't use it.

[chunk.xml] replace notepad++'s own lua syntax with this, do it yourself.

If something's missing
